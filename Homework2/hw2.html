            I read chapter five which was about expressing emotions and senses through comics. 
            Until reading this chapter, I never really considered this issue. 
            I have read a few comics and sensed the intended emotions without even 
            realizing the effort that the author/illustrator had put into that. 
            It reminded me a lot about those one sentence stories that 
            always had a beginning, middle, and an end 
            yet still conveyed a series of emotions by only using a few words. 
            Every type of artist struggles to convey senses and emotions in their own way. 
            Painters use imagery, sculptures use malleable objects, 
            musicians use sound and language, writers use language, 
            dancers use movement, and comics use language and imagery. 
            Comics rely mostly on imagery to convey emotions or senses 
            (the invisible drivers of any story).  
            No matter how you choose to convey them, emotions and senses 
            are necessary in any type of story.

            Pasted around are a few screenshots of different emotions or senses in comics.
