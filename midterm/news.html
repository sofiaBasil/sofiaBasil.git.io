  <p>
    180-Turning Lives around is an incredible group that has helped 
    countless families and continues to do so. Their focus is on giving help when needed, 
    helping people find help, and educating people on the dangers of 
    domestic violence. This organization has helped my family exponentially 
    and I would like to create a site that helps people find the help they need. 
    Finding and asking for help is often scary and dangerous. This site will act 
    as a simple news page until clicking a button. Once the button is clicked it will 
    take the user to a page where they can find help in their area, 
    a page where they can find instantanous help such as the number for a hotline, 
    and finally a page with empowering and calming messages of hope and strength.
