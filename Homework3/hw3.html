                Tim Berners Lee's Long Live the Web is an extremely dated piece 
                filled with great intentions. I believe this piece was written about ten years 
                ago in 2010. It is now 2020 and everything he warned us about happening is happening, 
                and honestly has been happening since before he wrote this article. 
                Our freedoms do not extend into the digital world. 
                This is terrifying because our daily lives are lived almost completely online. 
                If our entire lives are now virtual, shouldn't our freedoms and rights follow us 
                into this digital world? The government has access to everything we search online 
                but perhaps that isn't even our greatest threat. 
                We willingly give our hearts and souls to social media platforms just to show the 
                world the only side of us that we want them to see. Little do we know, 
                that while on the outside out social media profiles look stellar, 
                these social media companies see all the imperfections behind the scenes 
                and profiting off of these imperfections. 
                They are constantly tracking every little piece of us. 
                They have paid engineers who spend their days piecing together personalities 
                based on our "likes" and "retweets." 
                This is dangerous and has to stop. 
                We have no privacy. 
                We are willingly giving up our data for FREE to these huge companies 
                who profit off of all of the information we give them. We are data. 
                People are data. We have to start educating ourselves and our children on what is at 
                stake and how to protect ourselves.
