  <p>
    I was born and raised in Monmouth County, New Jersey. 
    It's close to NYC, the beach, farm land, wooded areas, and excellent food. 
    NJ is also home to come of the most incredible musicians and bands.
    Check out Deal Casino for some great NJ music. 
    As much as I would like to travel the world, 
    I can't see myself leaving Mounmouth county. 
    (Central Jersey exists and it is only Monmouth County).
