        <h1 style="color:#FFFAF0">My Thoughts</h1>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            I think John Berger is a weird guy, but come to think of it, 
            I don't think they make artists that have never been called weird. 
            He opened up episode one by saying that 
            "a large part of seeing depends on habit and convention." 
            To me, that means anyone can look at something and analyze it, 
            but an expert appreciates how something is done and is trained to pay attention 
            to certain things. I do not know much about art, but I do know a lot about music. 
            I have played bass in a rock band since I was 6 years old. 
            I believe this experience has changed the way I listen to music. 
            When I hear a song, I hear the different parts and how everything fits together perfectly. 
            I do not get the same feeling of fulfillment listening to "Firework" by Katy Perry 
            as I do listening to "Paranoid Android" by Radiohead. 
            Musicians like to throw around the term "bad music" all the time. 
            "Bad music" can be defined as music that can be appreciated easily by untrained ears. 
            I think what John Berger means by "a large part of seeing depends on habit and convention" 
            is that you can't really see a photo until you know and learn what to look for. 
            I never considered thinking about art the same way that I listen to music. 
            I usually stare at a piece in the modern art section of the MET and walk away 
            after about 30 seconds thinking to myself 
            "man, I would love to make money painting an entire canvas one shade of blue." 
            In the future, I think it would be interesting to research a bit more on modern art 
            so I can look at it and appreciate it how it was intended.

        <h1 style="color:#FFFAF0", style=>Some interesting quotes</h1>
        <ul> 
            <li> "Paintings are no longer stationary, you can access them from any screen. 
                Their meanings are no longer stationary." - John Berger (Episode 1) </li>

            <li> "To be naked is to be oneself. To be nude is to be seen naked by others and not recognized for oneself. 
                A nude has to be seen as an object in order to be a nude." - John Berger (Episode 2) </li>

            <li> "Those who teach art make it into some kind of religion." - John Berger (Episode 3) </li>

            <li> "Animals are painted like pieces of furniture." - John Berger (Episode 3) </li>

            <li> "Publicity abuses the realities of public figures." - John Berger (Episode 4) </li>
        </ul>
